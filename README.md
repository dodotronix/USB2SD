# Bridge - USB TO SD Card 
This project is originally for 3d printer Anet. As the movement of the extruder
is shredded, when printing via USB serial connection. The shredding can be
avoided, when printing from the SDcard. This is not so confortable, because the
card has to be unplugged, inserted into the card reader to store the print data
and returned to the printer.
